Sources and Receivers
*********************

Seismic body waves travel away from their source, into the ground. As we have discussed earlier, the energy
spreads in all possible directions away from the source, heading directly toward geophones or propagating down into the earth where it might be reflected or refracted. When setting up a seismic survey, one must consider the type of sources and receivers to employ and how to arrange them in order to capture enough information to address the geological question at hand.

We will give an overview of some common source and receiver types, followed by an introduction to understanding survey geometry.
