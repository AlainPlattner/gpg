Fold
----

The fold refers to the number of times a particular subsurface point has been
sampled. It is equal to the number of traces in the CMP gather and is
numerically evaluated by

.. math::
 		fold = \frac{N (number\;of\;geophones)}{2n}

where :math:`n` is the moveup rate in units of geophone spacing. "Moveup rate"
is in fact (shot spacing)/(geophone spacing). For example, if geophones are 2
meters apart and shots are employed every 4 meters, then the moveup rate is
n=4/2=2. This can be less than one if there are shots set more often than
geophone spacing, a practice that is sometimes done in marine seismology,
especially ocean bottom profiling.

The schematic below shows a single ended spread with 8 geophones and moveup
rate of n=2.

We see that each point in the subsurface is sampled only twice. Notice that
the distance between the reflection points in the subsurface is half the
geophone spacing.










Common MidPoints (CMP)
----------------------
  	
Multiple shots and receivers are used in seismic profiling
specifically so that some subsurface points are sampled more than once.
Ultimately the goal is to identify all the reflections due to that point on
the various seismograms and stack these to get an enhanced signal to noise
ratio. The idea is illustrated on the upper figure.

The collection of seismic traces that correspond to a particular midpoint is
called a Common Midpoint (CMP) gather. In older literature, this collection of
traces was referred to as a Common Depth Point (CDP) gather. That is not
strictly correct, as the bottom diagram illustrates.

    reflections from a common point. When the layers are plane and horizontal
    then this common reflection point lies midway between the source and
    receiver

Elastic model for Earth rocks
--------------------------------

Recall from the :ref:`seismic velocity <seismic_velocity_duplicate>` page of the physical properties section that the earth deforms elastically when it is deformed by a source of seismic energy. These small elastic strains will propagate as waves away in all directions from the site of the original stress. The easiest way to obtain intuition about this is to think about rocks as being made up of a set of connected springs. Apply a force (stress) to any part and you will eventually get motion elsewhere. This propagation of energy is a type of wave motion. Elastic waves can be divided into two categories:

1. **Body waves** which travel through materials

2. **Surface waves** which propagate along boundaries between materials such
   as the air/earth interface.

Subtypes of these two categories are described below. Each wave type travels through a given material with a velocity that depends upon the elastic properties and density of the material.


Body Waves
----------

**Compressional waves (P waves)** propagate by compression and rarefaction and
the velocity of such waves, :math:`v_p`, in a material with bulk modulus :math:`K`, shear modulus :math:`\mu`, and density :math:`\rho` is given by the equation

.. math::
	v_p = \sqrt{ \frac{K + 4/3\mu}{\rho} }.

The figure below shows a simple animation of the motion associated with P waves.

**Shear waves (S waves)** propagate by a pure shear strain perpendicular to the
wave propagation. The propagation speed :math:`v_s` is given by

.. math ::
	v_s = \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\rho} }.

The below animation shows the propagation of a vertically polarized S wave. Note that an S wave could also be horizontally polarized, meaning that particle motion would be in the y direction in the coordinate system of the animation, as opposed to the z direction for vertical polarization.

Note that if :math:`\mu = 0` then :math:`v_s = 0`. This tells us that shear
waves do not travel in a liquid.

Seismic reflection and refraction surveying is usually carried out by the analysis of P waves. S-waves can also be used but they are harder to generate artificially compared to P-waves and require more complex receivers than ones designed to measure just P-waves. In marine surveys (unless sources and receivers are coupled directly to the ocean bottom) it is not possible to generate or measure S-waves at all. However, since :math:`v_s < v_p`, there are situations where it is beneficial to
use S-waves instead of P-waves.


Surface Waves
-------------

**Rayleigh waves** propagate along a free surface or on the boundary between two
materials. Particle motion is a retrograde ellipse, and in the same plane as
wave energy propagation. The amplitude of particle motion decays
exponentially with depth. Rayleigh wave speed :math:`v_R < v_S`. Large
earthquakes can generate Rayleigh waves that circumnavigate the globe. This
provides information about the velocity structure in the upper few hundred
kilometers of the earth.

**Love waves** exist in a surface layer when the shear wave velocity of the
upper layer is less than the shear wave velocity of the lower layer. The
waves are trapped in the upper layer and the particle motion is parallel to
the free surface and perpendicular to the direction of propagation.

.. math::
	v_{S1} < v_{Love} < v_{S2}

Both Love waves and Rayleigh waves are **dispersive**. That is, different
frequency components travel at different speeds. So the wave changes shape as
it travels. Also, the dispersion can be used to provide information about the
velocity structure in the upper region of the earth. For shallow work, it is
possible to generate surface waves artificially, and then observe the waves at
a series of locations at increasing distances from the source. This type of
field work is sometimes called **multi-channel analysis of surface waves** or
MASW. This is usually considered an "advanced" topic in applied geophysics.


Wave Velocity and Particle Velocity
-----------------------------------

Seismic waves typically travel in the ground at 2-7 km/s. This is the velocity
at which the energy moves, not the particles themselves. For comparison, sound
travels in air at approximately 0.33 km/s. The wave energy can be recorded
many kilometers from the source even if the source is small. The velocity and
displacements of individual particles in the rocks are however very small;
typical particle speeds are :math:`10^{-8}` m/s and typical ground
displacements are :math:`10^{-10}` m. For a list of velocities of some common
earth materials and a discussion of the geological factors that affect
velocities please see the :ref:`seismic velocity <seismic_velocity_duplicate>` page on the physical properties
section of this site.
