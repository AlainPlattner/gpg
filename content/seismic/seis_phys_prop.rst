Physical properties
===================

The three main physical properties that affect seismic waves are
density :math:`\rho`, bulk modulus :math:`K`, and shear modulus
:math:`\mu`. From your intro to geology course, you are familiar with
P-waves and S-waves. Their velocities can be calculated from these
three properties. In this section, we discuss each of these properties
in detail.
